dany brown by jayson greene contributing editor rap october 7 2019 on his fifth album by dany brown ascends to a sort of classicist nirvana and remains one of the most inventive and dimensional rappers working today dany brown s breakout album came the year he turned 30 now that he s closing in on 40 he doesn t seem to be settling into an role judging by his new album he hasn t settled at all never look back i will never change up he chants repeatedly on the first vow to never let a groove become a rut to stay the same without repeating yourself it s a lonely sort of promise but it s one that he s kept he remains as defiantly hard to situate now in the rap landscape today as he was in 201 back then he was ostentatiously weird a detroit rapper with a hyena voice who forever altered the smell and taste of cool ranch doritos a weirdo fashion plate back when something as mild as skinny jeans could cost you a label deal now that he looks like an original to soundcloud rap s new mutants he s still an outlier his devotion to punchlines and similes makes him sound almost rigid in the melted borderles landscape of current rap but this is the joy and pain of being a human in your records over and over again if you do it correctly you l never quite fit in anywhere ever when he announced that was going to his new album he reaffirmed that he was a classicist at heart an formalist in freak s clothing they are an odd pairing the abstract and the hybrid s music has always felt comfortable and your feet on the rug relax yourself please settle down his aesthetic is built on leaving space while figuring out how to make the quietest sound the most interesting one dany brown s most compelling music meanwhile has usually felt ready to leap out of its own skin full of scraped nerves nosebleeds migraines grinding teeth working with tip brown doesn t tone his style down so much as modulate it dotting his voice across these tracks like wasabi blobs he mostly forgoes the theatrics of 2016 s atrocity exhibition and 2013 s old opting for punchlines and vivid images and creative over the jagged rhyme patterns of a song like negro spiritual and you might prick your finger he around the looped guitar so nimbly it might escape your notice that he rhymes on par rental car centaur and pat benatar within one gulp of breath brown usually lunges out of beats but here melts into them making himself just another bright leaping dot on a cartoon assembly line individual production credits come from longtime collaborator paul white jpegmafia flying lotus and himself who coaxes and calms these nervy beats into a suite full of irregular rhythms and snipped edges the snare snap on jpeg s 3 tearz hits either a later or sooner than you expect prompting the loosest and most unpredictable verses from killer mike and in years s own dirty laundry basically loops a full minute of aurora spinray a quivering instrumental from the 70s psychedelic group syrinx and destabilizes the rhythm so much that listening to it feels walking across a waterbed these are the kinds of tactile pleasures offers brown has never sounded more musical natural or he reels off quotable lines everywhere heny got me wetter than whale ma die for this shit like elvis from combat is a particularly rich one as is i ignore a whore like an email from linkedin from savage structurally at least he s a punchline rapper and from this angle producing him might not be that different from producing a happy pugilist like phife dawg who similarly wanted to fill whatever small container he was given with the maximum amount of his personality as he trades bars with tip over the trilling horn loop on combat zone it sounds like brown has ascended to a sort of classicist nirvana a place where every kick drum lands every sample clears effortlessly every loop cuts off exactly where it should if there s anything missing from it s a sense of mortal stakes a feeling that this music matters to brown on a gut level his best music has always been overwhelmingly personal and when he declared that he would be the greatest rapper ever on xxx s 30 the implication was that he might die if he failed it is an unqualified good thing that he is not rapping about suicidal thoughts depression isolation and drug abuse anymore but whatever else is in his head is missing there is no moment where brown grabs your lapels and demands you to feel what he s feeling whatever it may be he has called his standup comedy album and the mastery on display is that of the comic going out there and killing but the and most enduring comedians left their own blood out on the stage too
