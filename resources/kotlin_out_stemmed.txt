 jav feat what is kotlin the jav altern explain kotlin off big adv ov jav for jvm and android develop and play nic with jav in the sam project why not giv it a try by martin hel contribut edit infoworld oct 26 2017 what is kotlin the jav altern explain kotlin is a gen purpos op sourc statica typ pragm program langu for the jvm and android that combin and funct program feat it is focus on interop saf clar and tool support vert of kotlin for javascrib ecmascrib and nat cod us lvm ar in the work kotlin origin at jetbrain the company behind intelid ide in 2010 and has been op sourc sint 2012 the kotlin team cur has mor than 20 memb from jetbrain and the kotlin project on github has about 100 contribut jetbrain us kotlin in many of it produc includ it flag intelid ide what is kotlin the jav altern explain tut get start with kotlin kotlin framework a survey of jvm develop tool keep up with hot top in program with infoworld s ap dev report newslet convert jav to kotlin idg at first glant kotlin look lik a streamlined vert of jav consid the screnshot abov wher i hav convert a jav cod sampl at left to kotlin autom not that the mindless repetit inh in instanty jav vary has gon away the jav idiom stringbuilder sb new stringbuilder in kotlin becom val sb stringbuilder you can see that funct ar defin with the fun keyword and that semicolon ar now opt when newlin ar pres the val keyword decl a property or loc vary simil the var keyword decl a mut property or loc vary nevertheless kotlin is strongly typ the val and var keyword can be us on when the typ can be infer otherw you nee to decl the typ typ inf seem to be improv with each releas of kotlin hav a look at the funct decl near the top of both pan the return typ in jav prec the prototyp but in kotlin it success the prototyp demarc with a colon as in pasc hpe grenlak bal it flex cost and control with accel outcom on yo term brandpost spons by hpe hpe grenlak bal it flex cost and control with accel outcom on yo term busy demand flex but it nee control the answ consum it on yo term it is not obvy from thi exampl but kotlin has relax jav s requir that funct be class memb in kotlin funct may be decl at top level in a fil loc insid oth funct as a memb funct insid a class or object and as an extend funct extend funct provid the c abl to extend a class with new funct without hav to inherit from the class or us any typ of design pattern such as dec for groovy fan kotlin impl build in fact kotlin build can be typ check kotlin support deleg property which can be us to impl lazy property observ property veto property and map property many asynchron mech avail in oth langu can be impl as libr us kotlin coroutin which ar expery in kotlin thi includ from c and ecmascrib channel and select from go and from c and python funct program in kotlin allow funct is just the begin of the funct program story for kotlin the langu also support funct anonym funct lambda inlin funct clos tail recurs and gen in oth word kotlin has al of the feat and adv of a funct langu for exampl consid the follow funct kotlin idiom filt a list in kotlin val posit x x 0 for an ev short express us it when ther is on a singl paramet in the lambd funct val posit it 0 travers a of pair in kotlin for k v in map println k v k and v can be cal anyth us rang in kotlin for i in clos rang includ 100 for i in 1 until 100 rang doe not includ 100 for x in step 2 for x in 10 downto 1 if x in the abov exampl show the for keyword as wel as the us of rang ev though kotlin is a funct program langu it preserv most of the nat of jav as an altern program styl which is very handy when convert ex jav cod kotlin has class with construct along with nest in and anonym in class and it has interfac lik jav 8 kotlin doe not hav a new keyword to cre a class inst cal the construct just lik a regul funct we saw that in the screnshot abov kotlin has singl inherit from a nam superclass and al kotlin class hav a default superclass any which is not the sam as the jav bas class any contain on three predefin memb funct eq hashcod and tost kotlin class hav to be mark with the op keyword in ord to allow oth class to inherit from them jav class ar kind of the opposit as they ar inherit unl mark with the fin keyword to overrid a superclass method the method itself must be mark op and the subclass method must be mark overrid thi is al of a piec with kotlin s philosoph of mak thing explicit rath than rely on default in thi particul cas i can see wher kotlin s way of explicit mark bas class memb as op for inherit and der class memb as overrid avoid sev kind of common jav er saf feat in kotlin speak of avoid common er kotlin was design to elimin the dang of nul point ref and streamline the handl of nul valu it doe thi by mak a nul illeg for standard typ ad nul typ and impl shortcut not to handl test for nul for exampl a regul vary of typ string can not hold nul var a string abc a nul compil er if you nee to allow nul for exampl to hold sql query result you can decl a nul typ by append a quest mark to the typ string var b string abc b nul ok the protect go a littl furth you can us a typ with impun but you hav to test a nul typ for nul valu bef us it to avoid the verbos gramm norm nee for nul test kotlin introduc a saf cal writ for exampl b return if b is not nul and nul otherw the typ of thi express is int in oth word b is a shortcut for if b nul els nul thi syntax chain nic elimin quit a lot of prolix log espec when an object was pop from a sery of databas query any of which might hav fail for inst bob would return the nam of bob s depart head if bob the depart and the depart head ar al to perform a certain op on for valu you can us the saf cal op togeth with let val listwithn list string listof a nul for item in listwithn item println it print a and ign nul oft you want to return a valid but spec valu from a nul express us so that you can sav it into a typ ther s a spec syntax for thi cal the elv op i kid you not writ val l b is the equ of val l int if b nul els in the sam vein kotlin lack jav s check exceiv which ar throwable condit that must be caught for exampl the jdk sign apend append charsequ csq throws ioexceiv requir you to catch ioexceiv every tim you cal an append method try mess catch ioexceiv e do someth with the exceiv the design of jav thought thi was a good ide and it was a net win for toy program as long as the program impl someth sens in the catch claus al too oft in larg jav program howev you see cod in which the mand catch claus contain noth but a com handl thi thi doesn t help anyon and check exceiv turn out to be a net loss for larg program kotlin for android up until may 2017 the on off support program langu for android wer jav and googl annount off support for kotlin on android at googl 2017 and start with android studio kotlin is built into the android develop tolset kotlin can be ad to ear vert of android studio with a kotlin compil to the sam byt cod as jav interop with jav class in nat way and shar it tool with jav becaus ther is no overhead for cal back and for between kotlin and jav ad kotlin incrementa to an android ap cur in jav mak perfect sens the few cas wher the interop between kotlin and jav cod lack grac such as jav property ar rar encount and easy fix pinterest was the post child for android ap writ in kotlin as ear as novemb 2016 and it was ment promin at googl 2017 as part of the kotlin annount in addit the kotlin team lik to cit the evernot trelo squ and courser ap for android kotlin jav the quest of wheth to choos kotlin or jav for new develop has been com up a lot in the android commun sint the googl annount although peopl wer already ask the quest in febru 2016 when kotlin ship the short answ is that kotlin cod is saf and mor cont than jav cod and that kotlin and jav fil can coex in android ap so that kotlin is not on us for new ap but also for expand ex jav ap the on cog argu i hav seen for choos jav ov kotlin would be for the cas of complet android develop newby for them ther might be a barry to surmount giv that most android docu and exampl ar in jav on the oth hand convert jav to kotlin in android studio is a simpl mat of past the jav cod into a kotlin fil for almost anyon els doing android develop the adv of kotlin ar compel the typ tim quot for a jav develop to learn kotlin is a few smal pric to pay to elimin nul ref er en extend funct support funct program and ad coroutin kotlin scal the quest of wheth to choos kotlin or scal doesn t com up oft in the android commun becaus the android tool support for scal just isn t very good and the scal libr for android tend to be on the larg sid on the oth hand the scal commun is keen aw of the issu and is work on solv for them in oth environ the situ is diff for exampl apach spark is most writ in scal and big dat apply for spark ar oft writ in scal in many way both scal and kotlin repres the fus of program as exempl by jav with funct program the two langu shar many conceiv and not such as immut decl us val and mut decl us var but diff slight on oth such as wher to put the arrow when decl a lambd funct and wheth to us a singl arrow or a doubl arrow the kotlin dat class map to the scal cas class kotlin defin nul vary in a way that is simil to groovy c and f most peopl get it quick scal on the oth hand defin nul vary us the opt monad which can be so forbid that som auth seem to think that scal doesn t hav nul saf on clear deficit of scal is that it compil tim tend to be long someth that is most obvy when you re build a larg body of scal such as the spark reposit from sourc kotlin on the oth hand was design to compil quick in the most frequ softw develop scenario and in fact oft compil fast than jav cod kotlin interop with jav at thi point you may be wond how kotlin handl the result of jav interop cal giv the diff in nul handl and check exceiv kotlin sil and rely inf what is cal a platform typ that behav exact lik a jav typ mean that is nul but can gen exceiv kotlin may also inject an assert into the cod at compil tim to avoid trig an act nul point exceiv ther s no explicit langu not for a platform typ but in the ev kotlin has to report a platform typ such as in an er mess it append to the typ
